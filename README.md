# Deep-Neural-Networks-with-PyTorch

This repository presents my implementation of the different labs of the Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch IBM certificat.

The course teach how to develop deep learning models using  Pytorch. The course start with Pytorch's  tensors and Automatic differentiation package. Then each section cover different models starting off with fundamentals such as Linear Regression, and logistic/softmax regression. Followed by  Feedforward deep neural networks, the role of different activation functions, normalization and dropout layers. Then Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer learning is covered. Finally, several other Deep learning methods is covered.
